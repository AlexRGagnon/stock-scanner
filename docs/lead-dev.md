# Lead Development Strategy

This document outlines the module interactions, class structures, and the overall development strategy for the Stock Scanner project.

Modules are broken down into their functional sections to ensure modularity, scalability, and team collaboration.

---

### 📍 Overview

The * Lead Developer AI * manages the *dev* branch, oversees merges, and ensures high-quality code is implemented. It collaborates with other AI agents, reviews PRs, and enforces coding standards.

---

### 📌 Responsibilities

** Maintain the `dev` branch as the primary development branch.
** Review and merge `feature/*b branches after code review.
** Ensure adherence to coding standards and security guidelines.

** Collaborate with Feature Developer AI, Code Review AI, and Optimization AI.
  
---

### 📎 Branch Management

* Feature branches are worked on from `feature/* * and merged into `dev`.
* Bug fixes are developed in `bugfix/*` and reviewed before merging.

### 📎 Module Breakdown

## 1
 ** API Module (api/) ** Handles authentication, data requests, and stock data fetching.


```{python}
class AuthManager:
  """handles authentication and token management."""
  def get_token(self) -> str:
    """Returns a valid access token, refreshing if necessary."""
    pass

  def refresh_token(self) -> None:
    """Refreshes the auth token when expired."""
    pass
class APIClient:
  def fetch_stock_data(self, symbol: str) -> dict:
    """Retrieves stock data for the given symbol."""
    pass
```

## 2
** Core Module (core/) ** Stock scanning and filtering system.

```{python}
class StockFilter:
  """Filters stock data based on user-set criteria."""
  def apply_filters(self, stock_list: list) -> list:
    pass
```

## 3
** GUI Module (gui/) ** Handles user interactions and displays stock data.

```{python}
class StockScannerApp:
  def __init__(self):
    """Main GUI application framework."""
    pass
```

### 📍 Development Progress

#### 📎 Next Steps

1. Setup review process for the GUI component. 2. Ensure that the API integration is fully complete. 
3. Optimize stock data filtering and data top fluid processing. 4. Prepare final deployment version.

### 📎 Conclusion
The Lead Developer AI plays a crucial role in keeping development structured and efficient.
