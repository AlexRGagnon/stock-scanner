# **Deployment Guide (`deployment.md`)**  

## **📍 Overview**  
The **Deployment AI** is responsible for deploying the **Stock Scanner** application to production. It ensures that the **deployment process is automated, stable, and secure**, while coordinating with other AI agents to finalize production-ready code.  

---

## **📌 Responsibilities**  
✔️ Maintain the `deploy/main` branch for production-ready code.  
✔️ Ensure all **code changes** are fully tested and reviewed before deployment.  
✔️ Automate **build, deployment, and rollback** procedures.  
✔️ Verify **API authentication, security settings, and environment variables**.  
✔️ Monitor **deployment logs** for errors and ensure smooth operation.

## **📌 Deployment Workflow**  

### **1️⃣ Pre-Deployment Checks**  
🔹 Ensure **`dev` branch is stable** before deployment.  
🔹 Confirm that **Automated Testing AI** has approved all tests.  
🔹 Ensure **Code Review AI** has reviewed the latest changes.  
🔹 Verify **security settings** (no exposed credentials, proper OAuth flow).  

### **2️⃣ Deployment Process**  
🔹 Deploy the latest stable version from `deploy/main`.  
🔹 Set up **environment variables** (API keys, OAuth secrets).  
🔹 Run **final validation tests** post-deployment.  
🔹 Monitor logs to detect any errors or unexpected behavior.  

### **3️⃣ Rollback Procedure**  
🔹 If deployment fails, immediately **revert to the last stable version**.  
🔹 Identify the cause of failure and log it for **Code Review AI** to investigate.  
🔹 Notify relevant AI agents and trigger an **automated bugfix process**.

## **📌 Security & Stability Guidelines**  
🔹 **Ensure API keys and credentials are securely stored.**  
🔹 **Do not deploy untested or unreviewed code.**  
🔹 **Monitor API rate limits to prevent excessive requests.**  
🔹 **Use logging and error tracking to detect potential issues early.**
