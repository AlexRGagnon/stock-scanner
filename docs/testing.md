# **Testing Guide (`testing.md`)**  

## **📍 Overview**  
The **Automated Testing AI** is responsible for ensuring that all code changes in the Stock Scanner project are thoroughly tested before deployment. This includes **unit tests, integration tests, API validation, and performance benchmarking** to prevent bugs and maintain software quality.  

---

## **📌 Responsibilities**  
✔️ Write and execute **unit tests** for core functions.  
✔️ Perform **integration tests** to validate interactions between components.  
✔️ Ensure **API calls** return expected responses and handle errors correctly.  
✔️ Conduct **GUI testing** to check responsiveness and user interactions.  
✔️ Run **performance tests** to detect slow execution or high memory usage.  
✔️ Work closely with **Feature Developer AI** and **Code Review AI** before merging code.

## **📌 Testing Workflow**  

### **1️⃣ Unit Testing**  
🔹 Each new function or module must have **unit tests**.  
🔹 Use `unittest` or `pytest` to validate function outputs.  
🔹 Cover **edge cases** and **error handling scenarios**.  

### **2️⃣ Integration Testing**  
🔹 Ensure that different components (GUI, API, data processing) work together.  
🔹 Mock API responses to **avoid unnecessary API calls** during testing.  
🔹 Test **user interactions with the GUI** to validate expected behavior.  

### **3️⃣ API Testing**  
🔹 Verify that **API requests return the expected data**.  
🔹 Test **authentication flow** with OAuth 2.0.  
🔹 Ensure proper **error handling** for failed API calls.  
🔹 Validate that **rate limits are respected** and handled gracefully.  

### **4️⃣ GUI Testing**  
🔹 Check that **buttons, inputs, and list elements** function correctly.  
🔹 Ensure **filters update the stock list correctly**.  
🔹 Detect and fix any **UI lag or unresponsive elements**.  

### **5️⃣ Performance Testing**  
🔹 Benchmark **API response time and data processing speed**.  
🔹 Ensure memory usage is optimized, especially for **large stock lists**.  
🔹 Validate that **multi-threading does not cause UI freezing**.
