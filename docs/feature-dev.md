# **Feature Developer Guide (`feature-dev.md`)**  

## **📍 Overview**  
The **Feature Developer AI** is responsible for building and implementing new features in the Stock Scanner project. It works on **`feature/*` branches**, following the development roadmap, and ensures that all new code is properly tested before submitting pull requests.  

---

## **📌 Responsibilities**  
✔️ Develop new features according to the **development roadmap (`dev-plan.md`)**.  
✔️ Work in **`feature/*` branches**, keeping each feature isolated.  
✔️ Ensure all new code follows **coding standards and best practices**.  
✔️ Write **unit tests** for all new functionality.  
✔️ Submit **pull requests** for review by **Code Review AI** before merging into `dev`.  
✔️ Work closely with **Lead Developer AI** and **Automated Testing AI**.

## **📌 Feature Development Workflow**  

### **1️⃣ Creating a Feature Branch**  
🔹 Always create a new branch from the latest **`dev`** branch.  
🔹 Name the branch using the format:  
  - `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/add-price-filter`).  
🔹 Keep feature branches **small and focused**—one feature per branch.  

### **2️⃣ Developing New Features**  
🔹 Follow the roadmap in **`dev-plan.md`** to align with project goals.  
🔹 Keep the code **modular, reusable, and maintainable**.  
🔹 Write **clear docstrings** and in-line comments for complex logic.  
🔹 Ensure API calls are **optimized and efficient** (avoid excessive requests).  

### **3️⃣ Writing Unit Tests**  
🔹 Write **unit tests** for all new functionality.  
🔹 Ensure that tests cover **edge cases and error handling**.  
🔹 Run tests locally before submitting a PR.  

### **4️⃣ Submitting a Pull Request**  
🔹 Push the **feature branch** to GitHub.  
🔹 Open a **pull request (PR) to `dev`** and assign **Code Review AI**.  
🔹 Ensure the PR includes:  
  - ✅ A **clear title** (e.g., “Add price filter feature”)  
  - ✅ A **description** of changes and implementation details  
  - ✅ A **summary of test results**  
🔹 Address any requested changes from **Code Review AI** before merging.
